I was raised by farmers' kids. Both my parents are from rural villages in China (one Southern and one Northern), and growing up I visited my grandparents in the villages regularly. Though I was born and raised in a big city like Beijing, I was also raised with farmers' mindsets: never waste food as an appreciation for farmers' hard labor and the land. 

During Fall 2023, I took the urban farming course at University of Washington offered by the department of Landscape Architecture to first really learn how to farm and learn about . As part of the course, I volunteered at the [UW Farm](https://botanicgardens.uw.edu/center-for-urban-horticulture/gardens/uw-farm/). After graduating from UW and started working at Microsoft, I missed the farm life and started volunteering at the UW Farm again.

Farming helps me restructure my relationship with the food I consume everyday and reconnect me back to the soil/dirt, insects, plants --- which are the land that I stood upon and feed me. It also brings me back to my childhood memories --- during holidays. Living in a high speed, high technology, capitalistic world where labor is highly specialized, there is some unique and therapeutic pleasure of growing the food you eat and sustain oneself. (Interestingly, talking to the UW farm staff, they told me MANY farming volunteers are Computer Science majors. Maybe they found the same pleasure as I did.)

While harvesting is always fun and joyful, you really learn the "behind the scenes" of farming when preparing the beds for the next season. Farming is a lot more than laboring on the land. It also invovles intentional planning, budgeting, and many maths to decide how to rotate crops between beds and saving seeds ahead of time. It feels like PMing a piece of land. For example, in the photo below, we gleaned the plants previously growing on there (which is a very stress relieving activity), measured, plowed, fertilized the beds, and seeded the [cover crops](https://www.usda.gov/about-usda/general-information/initiatives-and-highlighted-programs/peoples-garden/soil-health/cover-crops-and-crop-rotation) so the land can take a proper break after three busy seasons.
