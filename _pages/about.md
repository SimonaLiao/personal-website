Hello, welcome to my page! :leaves:

I work and study at the intersection of `Human and AI interactions`. Currently, I am a full-time Product Manager at Microsoft, building `GitHub Copilot` in Visual Studio :computer:. Before working full-time, I was a Masters student at `University of Washington`, advised by [Prof. Amy Zhang](https://amyzhang.info/) in her [Social Future Lab](https://social.cs.washington.edu/).

I also completed my undergrads at `University of Washington`, with double majors in [Computer Science](https://www.cs.washington.edu/) and [Gender, Women, and Sexuality Studies](https://depts.washington.edu/gwss/) (learn more about my interdisciplinary journey [here](https://artsci.washington.edu/news/2022-09/intersection-stem-and-feminism)). These two majors might seem unrelated at first, but in fact, they have a lot to do with each other! I deeply believe that technology needs to center human experience (which, now you might see naturally why I became a HCI researcher/PM) and technology is not as neutral as it seems to be. If you are curious, a good starting place to explore is [Data Feminism](https://data-feminism.mitpress.mit.edu/). 

I love teaching, mentoring and doing outreach. I was fortunate to have the opportunitiy to teach `Intro to HCI` for five quarters at UW and participated many science outreach events through Society of Women Engineers at UW. I also founded a [virtual mentorship program](https://taxingmentorship.github.io/TaXingWeb/) for Chinese women in tech since 2020, connecting hundreds of mentors and thousands of mentees. 

Outside of work, I enjoy crocheting, farming, getting into nature (espeically among the trees :tree:), cooking, gaming (both board games and video games), and lots of good movies/anime/books. If you have any questions or if there is anything I can help you, please don't hesitate to reach out via email! :mailbox:
