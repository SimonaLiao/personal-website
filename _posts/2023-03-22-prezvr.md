 While I was studying the harassment in social VR games for the research project, I wanted to enhance my knowledge in VR systems and programming. I was able to develop my Unity skills, familiarize with Quest/MRTK, and even recruited my future research partner from this course! Thanks a lot to Reality Lab for the awesome capstone class and the resources provided for my research project.


PrezVR’s VR tool suite enables presenters to create immersive presentations in VR and connect with their audiences at a new level of depth and understanding. With our easy-to-use UI, seamless scene transitions, and animation tools, presenters can showcase their vision for the future with ease. PrezVR allows for live editing, which means users can practice and make adjustments in real-time. Our product comes with an asset library, enabling users to build presentations from scratch in VR. Users can also instantaneously import custom assets into the scene without breaking their creative flow. PrezVR synchronizes animations and scene transitions across multiple users, enabling everyone, no matter where they are, to experience the presentation together in a shared space. Try PrezVR today!
