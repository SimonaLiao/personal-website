Growing up, I didn't considered myself good at crafting things. I remember vividly, during primary school it took me a while to learn how to tie my shoe laces nice and neat, as well as how to make myself a ponytail. My hands aren't always holding things nicely or in the way my brain wants them to. My mom sometimes said, jokingly, I should stay away from being doctors because it would be difficult for me to sew nice stitches. But I did fall in love with crochet, at age of 23.

What I really appreciate about crocheting is that every mistake can be forgiven and fixed very easily. Did a loop wrong? No problem, just go back and try again. Even if you want to start over, that's an viable option too because the yarn is flexible and can be undo and redo into different shapes. The stake is low, and making mistakes is no big deal. This is not the common scenario in most of my life, where the default is to do things right and screw things up could lead to very bad outcomes (though many are not true and just my imagination). Yarn showed me how to be forgiving to myself, even though that's not always given from others or from the outside world. It's okay to go back, and restart. At anytime.

I had multiple crocheting projects, and one of my goal is to give each of my friends's pets a little cute decoration! Here is the current collection!

If you are interested in getting started, I highly recommend you to buy a beautiful yarn with the color you like (e.g. the cake yarn always have many pretty gradient colors) and make a scarf or a blanket that has very repetitive patterns. So you can focus on the basic skills and get a good outcome with beautiful colors. (:warning: Don't buy too many yarn though it requires lots of self-control to resist...I definitely hoarded too many yarns.)
